/*
Welcome to Visual Studio Code, Expo components! This software isn't as jealous, manipulative and
downright evil as Expo, so you'll definitely like it here! For components like Mr. Fatal Firebase Error
(I thought he was assassinated), who has recently been resurrected, keep your messed up nose out
of this app please and thank you.

Otherwise, welcome to those components that have been mutated, and I hope you like your great new blue
background. Blue's supposed to be the colour of peace, which is not what I'm expecting from you guys,
but I'm still going to be optimistic

And for my old friends, the elks...

Grass, grass, grass, grass, elk, grass, grass, grass, grass, LETTUCE! 
There. More than enough grass

And for my other friends, the lynxes...

Salad, salad, salad, lynx.

You're going to have to eat salad for now... I'm not letting you gobble up mice

Back to sentimentalAttachments.js...

There's a random screen open, a black one, which I have ABSOLUTELY no idea about. That's weird, maybe
I should cancel it or something. Or I could have ANOTHER fake trial!!!

Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to today's trial. The accused is Ms. Squiggly Underline, accused of
detaining '../assets/bookLogo.jpg' under shady circumstances. Although this must be very terrifying
to the honest components in the audience, Ms. Squiggly Underline has to be sentenced by the judge
for a breach of good component protocol

"THERE'S NO SUCH PROTOCOL!!!"
"Do we get free snacks?"
